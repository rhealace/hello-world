# hello-world
first real repository
realace here, I am just trying to learn coding and I am new to all this. So any help is always much apprieciated. I tried to do the course on Udemy, and I was lost. At first thought I was a little upset with the instructer, for not explaining things.
So now I'm doing the exersises on git and I feel much better. Thank You Git!
I still think the instructer dude needs to slow down and explain how to do what he is doing. It says beginners course, and he is not doing beginner work. Just my opinion at this moment.
